# Shell

This shell supports unix-style job control. It repeatedly prints a prompt, waits for a program name and command-line arguments on stdin (i.e., the terminal window), then carries out some action as directed by the input. Some things that this shell can do include parsing command line input, running forgrounded and background processes, forking child processes, and processing signal handlers.
